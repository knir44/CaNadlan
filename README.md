# CaNadlan

## Introduction

"CaNadlan" is an machine learning project designed to predict apartment prices based on specific characteristics and details.
By leveraging advanced algorithms, the system learns from the provided data to make accurate predictions about the expected values of apartments.
This predictive model can be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses involved in real estate in Canada, offering insights into the potential market values of apartments based on their unique features.

## Structure
In the initial phase of the project, conducted web crawling to gather valuable information from Remix, utilizing Selenium for this purpose. Subsequently,
the collected data was transformed into a structured Excel table and seamlessly transmitted to a dedicated Telegram channel.

After the web crawling , there was done  data cleaning and addressed missing values to ensure the integrity and accuracy of our dataset.
This meticulous preparation paved the way for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage, during which we performed thorough statistical analyses to gain insights into the intricacies of the data.

Transitioning into the realm of machine learning,  implemented a regression model to predict apartment prices.
Impressively, our model achieved a accuracy rate of 62%, signifying its proficiency in predicting prices based on the identified features.
